# d3

The main focus of this homework and repo is the webpage (index.html) where I experimented with creating an SVG using D3. I used Youyou's exercise as a basis (folder lede24-svg-with-D3 included in this repo). My data enabled a similar visualization, which made the process easier. There is also a notebook included where I process the CSV data with pandas.

The data concerns board seats in Finnish listed companies. My data combines the names of board members and the number of seats, but it does not include, for example, information about the companies whose boards are involved.

I asked ChatGPT for help when creating a legend for the SVG.

It's frustrating how long (a total of about 6 hours) it took to produce something this simple!

## Animation with button

As a homework assignment, I added a button to my page to make the chart appear. Initially, I wanted to make an animation with an SVG image, but it was too hard (even with youtube guides...). Making this required asking ChatGPT, so I don't know if I really learned anything - just that making graphics with coding is really, really difficult.
